This package contains geographic, use, and property related data on airports.

## Installation

You can install the package from [CRAN](https://CRAN.R-project.org) with:

``` r
install.packages("airports")
```

Additionally, you can install the development version of airports from GitHub with:

```r
#install.packages("devtools")
library(devtools)
install_github("OpenIntroStat/airports")
```

## Usage

The datasets from this package can be used in a teaching context for data visualization and data manipulation exercises.

## airports and openintro

The datasets from this package are used in [OpenIntro](https://www.openintro.org/) textbooks and other  resources.
These datasets originally lived in the [**openintro**](http://openintrostat.github.io/openintro/) package, up until openintro 2.0.0.
The motivation for extracting these datasets out of the openintro package was to create a new package where we can continue to add more data on airports from all over the world.
For those looking for a seamless experience with OpenIntro resources, note that the contents of this package will be loaded along with the openintro package as well, so that you can run `library(openintro)` and use the datasets from airports.

## Questions, bugs, feature requests

You can file an issue to get help, report a bug, or make a feature request.

When filing an issue to get help or report a bug, please make a minimal **repr**oducible **ex**ample using the  [reprex](https://reprex.tidyverse.org/) package. 
If you haven't heard of or used reprex before, you're in for a treat! 
See [here](https://www.tidyverse.org/help/) for additional reprex pointers.

Before opening a new issue, be sure to [search issues and pull requests](https://github.com/openintrostat/airports/issues) to make sure the bug hasn't been reported and/or already fixed in the development version. 
By default, the search will be pre-populated with `is:issue is:open`. 
You can [edit the qualifiers](https://help.github.com/articles/searching-issues-and-pull-requests/)  (e.g. `is:pr`, `is:closed`) as needed. 
For example, you'd simply remove `is:open` to search _all_ issues in the repo, open or closed.
